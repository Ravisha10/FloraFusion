# Future Scope: 
The Crop Disease Detection Model, will enable users to upload images of plant leaves for instant
analysis and determine whether the crop is healthy or diseased. In the case of diseases, the system
will not only identify the disease name but also suggest tailored strategies for prevention and cure.
